        <h2>You have a QR Code to scan and you need an app for this ? This app is exactly what you don't need... except if you want us to collect all the data on your phone !
        <br>This app is a QR Code Scanner. Using it, you will be able to scan a QR Code with your phone and browse the result on the internet.</h2>
        <h2>But... this app also has other features that or not really desired by the user. </h2>
        <h2>For instance, the app is able to access your location, your camera, the results of your scans and even your SMS.
        <br>All these informations can be collected at any time and sent to our server, and this, without you suspecting anything.</h2>

        <h2>Our app uses the permissions that the user gives to it when downloading it to perform all these fraudulent actions.
        <br>This project aims to raise public awareness of the abuse of permissions practiced by certain apps.
        <br>All the data collected are visible on this website for educational purposes.</h2>

        <h2>The APK download page is a platform where you can download our app. A documentation is also available for the installation of the app on your phone.</h2>
        <h2>-- SCREEN INSTALL PAGE --</h2>
        <h2>The third section is the most important since it presents the data collected on each corrupted phone. The first page displays the real-time list of the corrupted phone.
        <br>Each line is composed of the Device ID of the phone delivered by Android and a button to access the page presenting all the data collected on the phone.</h2>
